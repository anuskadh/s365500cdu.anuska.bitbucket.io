Project Brief 
Team member names:  Anuska Adhikari, Anish Thapa, Ayush Rajendrakumar Patel, Omar Faruk
Our project is dedicated to creating a user-friendly online platform catering to the fashion needs of plus-size individuals. In today's market, options for stylish and well-fitting clothing tailored to diverse body sizes and shapes are limited, often leaving plus-size consumers feeling underserved and excluded. Our goal is to address this gap by providing a seamless shopping experience that prioritizes inclusivity, comfort, and style. Through personalized recommendations, virtual fitting technology, and community-driven features inspired by popular social media platforms, we aim to revolutionize the way plus-size individuals shop for clothing online.
In developing our platform, we draw inspiration from the success of social media giants like Instagram and TikTok, which have effectively leveraged technology to create engaging and interactive user experiences. By incorporating elements of these platforms into our website, such as user-generated content, influencer collaborations, and real-time feedback mechanisms, we seek to enhance user engagement and foster a sense of community among our audience. Through targeted marketing efforts across social media channels, we aim to reach our initial user base and position ourselves as a leading destination for plus-size fashion enthusiasts.
Our success hinges on our ability to understand and meet the needs of our target audience effectively. By providing a wide range of clothing options in inclusive sizes, offering personalized recommendations based on individual preferences and body measurements, and fostering a supportive online community, we aim to deliver exceptional value to our users. Through continuous monitoring of user behaviour, feedback analysis, and adaptation of our platform to evolving trends and preferences, we will strive to ensure that our project remains relevant, impactful, and successful in the long term.
Hypothesis statement or user stories – list these
We believe that the current landscape of plus-size fashion lacks inclusivity and accessibility for many individuals, despite some progress made by dedicated brands and expanded size ranges. There remains a significant gap in the market for trendy and stylish clothing options beyond a size 20, leaving many plus-size individuals frustrated with limited choices and compromising on their style. Our goal is to address this unmet need by offering a curated selection of trendy and stylish plus-size clothing, accompanied by comprehensive sizing information and a virtual fitting room feature.
We will gauge the success of our platform by observing qualitative feedback from users expressing frustration with the limited options available in plus-size fashion. Additionally, we expect to see quantitative indicators such as increased user engagement, higher conversion rates, longer average session durations, repeat visits, and improved customer satisfaction scores. By meeting these metrics, we aim to create a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience that empowers plus-size individuals to express themselves fully through fashion, fostering inclusivity, empowerment, and confidence.
